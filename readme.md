# Clubs - Social Network for LMU Students

Welcome to Clubs, a dedicated social network platform exclusively designed for students of Loyola Marymount University (LMU). This platform enables students from the same classes or academic circles to connect, share, and engage in a secure and exclusive online environment.

## Features

- **Exclusivity**: Access restricted to LMU students only, requiring an LMU email for authentication.
- **User-Friendly Home Page**: Intuitively designed with four main sections:
  - **Header**: Includes a navigation panel for easy access to various features.
  - **Left Panel**: Shows user information and options to find and add new friends.
  - **Central Feed**: The heart of the platform where you can see and share posts.
  - **Right Panel**: Displays a list of your clubs with a feature to create new ones.

## Club Management

- **Creating a Club**: Simple process involving naming the club, adding a bio, and an image.
- **Engagement**: Once a club is created, students can join, post, comment, and interact with their peers.
- **Administrative Controls**: As a club admin, you can manage club members and content, including kicking and banning users as well as removing inappropriate posts.

## Discovering Clubs

- **Network-Based Discovery**: Find clubs through friends or academic connections on the site.
- **Shared Links**: Join clubs through direct shared links for easy access.
